## My notes

I would like to say that quite a lot of fun while working on this small task project. I would have liked to add a few more functionalities like pagination and such but I could only work on Sunday and hence was short on time. I really like frontend development. And so if there are a few things that you might think could have been better, kindly update me! I would love to learn from this experience. And also i hope that you like this project well enough to invite me for a second interview and also hopefully leads me to join your team.
